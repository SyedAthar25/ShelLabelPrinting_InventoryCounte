# PWA Setup Guide - Shelf Label Printing App

## 🎯 What We've Implemented

Your React app is now configured as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that can be installed on Android/iOS devices directly from Chrome/Safari!

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `public/manifest.json` - App metadata and icons configuration
- `public/service-worker.js` - Offline functionality and caching
- `src/components/PWAInstall.tsx` - Install prompt component
- `generate-icons.html` - Icon generator tool

### Modified Files:
- `index.html` - Added PWA meta tags and manifest reference
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated PWA install component
- `vite.config.ts` - Optimized build configuration

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Generate App Icons
1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click on each icon size to download
3. Save all icons to `public/icons/` folder with correct names:
   - `icon-16x16.png`
   - `icon-32x32.png`
   - `icon-72x72.png`
   - `icon-96x96.png`
   - `icon-128x128.png`
   - `icon-144x144.png`
   - `icon-152x152.png`
   - `icon-180x180.png`
   - `icon-192x192.png`
   - `icon-384x384.png`
   - `icon-512x512.png`

### 2. Test PWA Features
1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Chrome DevTools:**
   - Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
   - Go to **Application** tab
   - Check **Manifest** section
   - Verify **Service Workers** are registered

3. **Test Install Prompt:**
   - Look for the blue install banner in bottom-right
   - Click "Install" to test the prompt

## 📱 How Users Install Your App
